Your belief in me means a lot, especially when I struggle to believe in myself. You are truly amazing. Every day, you are the first thing on my mind. You are special and unique—no one has your personality or your smile. No one can compare to you. A world without you would be different, and your existence matters, no matter how you see it.

I want you to trust me completely and share your problems with me—I’m here to listen. I can’t promise a perfect relationship since we’ll face challenges and misunderstandings, but I promise to stand by your side and love you unconditionally, no matter what happens now or in the future.",
